Loan Approval Prediction

The main objectives of the project

The aim of this project is to create a Machine Learnig Model which will assist in 
the decision making in the bank whether to allocate a loan to an applicant or not.

The bank sells different products to its clients and loans are seemingly the most profitable. The bank has noted an increase in the number of defaulted loans and has tasked us to develop a machine learning based model to assist in the decision making of whether to allocate a loan to an applicant or not.

The bank has granted us access to a database of data that has different fields (predictors); they are however not sure if the parameters provided can be used to predict the probability of defaulting.

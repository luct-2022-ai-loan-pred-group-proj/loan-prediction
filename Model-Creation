The following file shows details on the steps taken in creating our model.

We used SVM for our model creation.
SVM (Support vector machines) are a set of supervised learning methods used for 
classification, regression, and outliers detection. All of these are common tasks in machine learning.

We steps we followed for model creation are:

1. Import the dataset
2. Explore the data to figure out what they look like
3. Pre-process the data
4. Split the data into attributes and labels
5. Divide the data into training and testing sets
6. Train the SVM algorithm
7. Make some predictions
8. Evaluate the results of the algorithm
9. Create Confusion Matrix
10. Tune the model
